Graphql

- A query layer between Client and Database.
- Graphql server serves graphql API.
- Idea is to visualize data into a tree/graph structure.

- Uniform URL used in REST APIs for each resource, which becomes hassle when sending requests for nested data
- GraphQL queries can traverse nested objects and their fields.
- Clients can fetch lots of nested data in one request, instead of making multiple requests.
- Graph model of data is more convenient to query nested data
